Lab #1

The website that I would like to create is a portfolio website. I really like this website style https://portfolio.adobe.com/examples/ due to its simplicity and video animation. 
I also like the Parlor KC website https://www.parlorkcmo.com/ due to its clean design, easy navigation, and clean responsive web design. 
You can scale it down to fit the mobile screen size, and it retains its original design.
